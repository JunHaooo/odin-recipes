    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another one of my comfort foods, so savoury and crispy. Follow along for a simple Roti Prata Recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Hot water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl of a stand mixer</li>
        <li>Knead on low speed for 10-12 minutes until the fough is smooth and won't break when stretched thin and can allow light to pass through.</li>
        <li>Divide the fough into 5 equal portions and roll them into a round ball. Add 2 tablespoon of cooking oil on a plate and rub it onto each dough</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with a cling wrap and rest for at least 2 hours</li>
        <li>Starting from the centre of the fough, use all 10 fingers to slowly stretch the fough out in all directions until you have 5 inch in diameter. Then gently pull the edge of the dough to stretch it out until it is 3 to 4 times its original size.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough in half then another half.</li>
        <li>Preheat a non-stick pan. Add about 1 tablespoon of cooking oil cook until golden brown and crisp over medium heat. Wait for about 1 minute, for plain and egg prata, use your hands to fluff and scrunch the dough.</li>
    </ol>
